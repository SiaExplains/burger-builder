Before starting to write code we should decalre, and define our conventions.

-   Directory Structures
-   Naming (Varibable, Components, Methods, etc.)

+src
|-- assets (all images, fonts, etc.)
|--+ components (all components)
...|--containers (all stateful components)

all component should store in a separate directory with Pascal-Case.
e.g: Box, BurgerComponent, Student, MenuListModal, etc.
